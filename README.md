# rc4pp
A [RC4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC4) C++ implementation.
## Why write this code?
I wrote this code while learning about cryptography and I chose RC4 because of its simplicity.

## Source files
- RC4.cpp and RC4.h are the implementation of the algorithm.
- main.cpp is an example of using the implementation to encrypt and decrypt a string.

This code is by no means perfect and is not meant for encrypting sensitive information, mainly because this is not a software for encrypting anything, this is just an implementation of a cryptography algorithm and secondly because the RC4 algorithm has been found to be [not secure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC4#Security) and easily crackable.
